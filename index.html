<h1>Welcome to Comic Sans Frontiers!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi There!</p>
<p>This site will soon be home of a pet project I've been wanting to set up for a few years: The ability for those nerdballers with extensive comic book, sci-fi novel, and RGP rulebook libraries to upload their finely curated volumes and share them with a larger community.</p>

<p>There are quite a few components I have zero skill points in right now (javascript, website login mechanisms, sumoning Cthonians with Dho-Nha geometry curves).
  I'll provide updates to the site as I gain exp, and hope to have a primitive model running this winter after I finish the database course I'm currently taking.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting, campers!</p>

<p><b>UPDATE: 10/11/16</b> I've been working on some basic HTML skillz and Git syncing, I hope to
  start a "Recent Changes" segment on the site soon.  (Just got Atom git pushing working!)
